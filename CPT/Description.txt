Custom Post Types
Custom Post Types enable you to create your own types of content in addition to those WordPress builts in already provides, which are:

  ■ Post
  ■ Page
  ■ Attachment
  ■ Link
  ■ Revision
  ■ Navigation Menu

Custom post types are displayed using one of the following template files, in order of precedence. For example,
for a single post of the post type product, the hierarchy would be as follows:

  ■ 1. single-product.php
  ■ 2. single.php
  ■ 3. index.php
  
For that post type’s archive listing, this would be the hierarchy:
  ■ 1. archive-product.php
  ■ 2. archive.php
  ■ 3. index.php

  To create a custom post type, you use the register_post_type() function, which has the following parameters:
